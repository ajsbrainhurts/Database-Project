# Grocery Store Database Project


For my project, I'd like to create an inventory control management system for a chain grocery store.


# Products: product name(ID), product type, price
# Customers: customer name(ID), contact info, amount paid
# Orders: order ID, total cost, date of order
# Discounts: discount ID, amount deducted, date of discount

# Questions / Use cases
1. I want to be able to place an order with this system and calculate the total price of said order.
2. Keep track of inventory within store and be able to restock when needed.
3. Apply discounts to items and calculate the price of an order after a discount has been applied.
